# WORK IN PROGRESS

So far, this contains most of the implementation from https://github.com/pyansys/grpc_chunk_stream_demo, which was used to demo streaming large arrays using gRPC (a bit non-standard but performant). Work was done adding the `demo` directory, containing the basis for a new project.

Lots of work needs to be done. See https://github.com/ansys/api-eigen-example/issues/1
