This Demo has some limitations such as: only 1D, 2D numpy.ndarrays are allowed; they must be of type float64.

    "        * Our Demo server has two resources implemented ``Matrices`` and ``Vectors``. Hence, we can only handle 1D and 2D numpy.ndarrays.\n",
    "    * When POSTing a resource, the request body contains the resource's information (i.e. our request will contain the 1D numpy.ndarray we want to POST). This information is usually serialized into a JSON format and the expected keys must be known by the client and the server to allow a proper interfacing. In a real REST application, the server usually exposes its metadata, which is basically the schema/structure of the different entities implemented (their names, attributes etc). This way, end users know how to interact with the server without knowing the specifics of the implementation.\n",

    "* After the POSTings are performed, we will now proceed to ask the server for a certain operation involving the resources submitted.\n",
    "    * Servers can also admit \"operations\". A typical standard for defining operation-endpoints would be:\n",
    "        * ``GET`` to ``${server-uri}/${operation}/${resource}`` --> In our demo: ``http://python-rest_server_1:5000/add/Vectors``\n",
    "    * These GET requests will also contain in its body the IDs of the involved resources:\n",

    "    * The server will then interact with the DB, retrieve the Vectors, call the Eigen Library (via a dedicated wrapper using pybind11), perform the operation and return the result.\n",
    "    * The client will then receive a response containing the result of the operation:\n",
    "        * ``{\"vector-addition\" : {\"result\" : [2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0] }}``\n",
    "        * The dedicated client implemented will then parse this JSON string and transform the resulting value into a numpy.ndarray.\n",
